        "2.   Lean and Mean:\n",
        "Establish a simple and limited set of directives for programming shared memory machines.\n",
        "Significant parallelism can be implemented by using just 3 or 4 directives.\n",
        "This goal is becoming less meaningful with each new release, apparently.\n",
        "3.   Ease of Use:\n",
        "Provide capability to incrementally parallelize a serial program, unlike message-passing libraries which typically require an all or nothing approach\n",
        "Provide the capability to implement both coarse-grain and fine-grain parallelism\n",

        "The API is specified for C/C++ and Fortran\n",
        "Public forum for API and membership\n",
